<div style="text-align: justify;">
This day marks a significant milestone in my academic journey and serves as a reminder of the amazing opportunities and experiences that lie ahead. <br/> <br/>

I have officially become a recipient of the prestigious <strong>performance-based scholarship</strong> award in recognition of my exceptional academic performance. I am honored to have been awarded a medal for achieving the highest CGPA in my class. This recognition symbolizes the culmination of countless hours of studying, researching, and striving for academic excellence. Additionally, I have also secured the second-place award for the best final project at the ECE Capstone Project expo (COMSPRO 2023). This achievement showcases the culmination of my efforts and the valuable contributions of my research group. Their dedication, expertise, and collaborative spirit were instrumental in the success of our project. I am particularly grateful to my undergraduate research advisor Prof. Rama Rao for his guidance and support, which also played a vital role in my accomplishments. <br/> <br/>

On this memorable day, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my friends, family, and the faculties in my department for their unwavering support throughout my entire B.Tech degree. Their constant encouragement, belief in my abilities, and willingness to help me make informed decisions have been invaluable. In particular, I want to extend my appreciation to my diverse cohort -- <strong>Viswadruth Akkaraju, Atanu Wadhwa, Chaitanya kumar, Atharva Rane, Anuj Rane, and Priya Korrapati</strong>. Their friendship, care, and support have been a constant source of motivation and strength during my academic journey. My accomplishments would not have been possible without the collective efforts and support of these amazing individuals. Their belief in me and their willingness to lend a helping hand have been crucial in shaping my success. I am truly grateful to have such loving, caring, and supportive friends and team members. <br/> <br/>
