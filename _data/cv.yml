      description:
        - Accelerated signal-processing pipeline for Hyperspectral Raman Imaging by optimizing and porting the implementation to GPU.
        - Resolved key bottlenecks in the pipeline to achieve significant speedup through batch processing of SVD.
        - Implemented automated metrics for SVD vector selection, organized post-processing analysis toolkit, and explored UNET phase error correction.

      description:
        - Created APEX, an automated tool-chain for unifying open-source distributed ML frameworks to study the impact of network configurations on collective algorithms through Design Space Exploration.
        - Translated auto-generated collective algorithm synthesizer outputs (TACOS) into MSCCLang IR, represented collectives as standardized Chakra Execution Traces (ETs), and bypassed the system layer of ASTRA-Sim, reducing engineering effort to create the IR for studying the impact of network parameters on collective algorithms in a distributed setup of GPUs.
        - Developed a configuration file to support the translation of heterogeneous topologies to study the impact of collectives on workloads and an interactive visualizer illustrating collective flows over GPU networks using Chakra ETs for agnostic collective patterns and network configurations.
