HiðŸ‘‹! I am Karthikeya Sharma, a graduate student pursuing MS in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering by research under the supervision of <strong><a href = "https://sites.gatech.edu/ece-callie/"> Prof. Callie Hao </a></strong> at Georgia Tech's <strong><a href = "https://sharclab.ece.gatech.edu"> SHARC Lab</a></strong>. My research interests primarily encompass <strong>Hardware-Software Co-design, Reconfigurable computing and Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</strong>. This website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, research projects, side quests, publications, and a glimpse of my personal life! <br/><br/>

Generative AI's computational demands are pushing the boundaries of traditional scaling paradigms. Innovations in distributed computing not only meet high-performance demands but also introduce challenges in scalability, communication overhead, and energy efficiency. My research aims to address these challenges arising from this paradigm shift to enable <strong>rapid prototyping</strong>, <strong>workload simulation</strong>, and <strong>performance evaluation</strong> of next-generation architectures focusing on the following research directions: <br/>

<ul>
  <li><u><strong>Co-design for large-scale hardware acceleration:</strong></u> How can we co-design efficient dataflow architectures with hardware-aware algorithms accounting for scalability?</li>
  <li><u><strong>Cutting-edge tools for Hardware-Software Co-design:</strong></u> How can we make better tools that push the boundaries of developing novel architectures that meet the demands of modern computing?</li>
</ul>
